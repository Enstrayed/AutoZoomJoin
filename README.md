# AutoZoomJoin
Unfinished program to automatically join Zoom links of classes. This code is considered INCOMPLETE and should only be used as reference or to complete the project. I have no interest in carrying this forward so will not be accepting PRs. This script was designed to work on Windows 10. This code has been licensed under the BSD 3clause in case somebody wants to complete the script. I have purged any restricted data from the files and added comments explaining future plans and what things do.
